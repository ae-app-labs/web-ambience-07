<h4>Lorem Ipsum   (Web Designing)</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In publishing and graphic design, lorem ipsum is standard placeholder text used to demonstrate the graphic elements of a document or visual presentation, such as font, typography, and layout.&quot;Lorem ipsum&quot; also approximates a typical distribution of letters in English, which helps to shift the focus to presentation. We named this event Lorem Ipsum in this context. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the main criteria for web designing is ease of accessibility and good design, we also give weightage to the technical side. This could include configuring a web server, displaying the date or doing a database operation. For this we are providing PHP as server side scripting, MySQL as database and Apache as server. </p>
