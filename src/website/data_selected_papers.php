<h3>Selected Paper Presentations</h3>
<p>These are the list of the finalised papers for Ilm Talk, the Paper Presentation competiton conducted by the Computer Science and Engineering Department of Mangalam College of Engineering, Ettumanoor. From a long list of abstracts, we had a tough time selecting these papers based on their relevance to the topic list suggested by us. Note that the order of the topics said here are completely in random and has nothing to do with any of the selection procedure. Remember that you need to do a spot registration for participating in this event on 30th of October 2007 before 10.00 Am.</p>
